          Our journey &ndash; From a Modest Start to a Nationwide Presence
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Our story began in 2016, with Star Suppliers operating from a small, home&ndash;based setup under a proprietorship model. What started as a humble venture was driven by a clear vision &ndash; to uplift and support India&apos;s aquaculture and fisheries sectors with quality products and dependable service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through hard work, persistence, and the trust of our customers, we steadily grew. By 2022, we had evolved into <strong>Star Multiventure Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, a corporate entity with operations spanning across India. Today, Star Multiventure proudly functions as a holding company, guiding and managing three dynamic sister concerns, each playing a vital role in strengthening the aquaculture value chain:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Star Suppliers &ndash;</strong> A name trusted by thousands, Star Suppliers delivers high-quality aquaculture equipment, fish farming tools, and fisheries supplies essential for both rural and commercial operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Star Fisheries &ndash;</strong> Focused on the lifeblood of aquaculture &ndash; fish seed and live fish sales &ndash; Star Fisheries ensures that farmers get access to healthy, fast-growing stock, contributing directly to sustainable and profitable farming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Star Feeds &ndash;</strong> Feeding growth, quite literally &ndash; Star Feeds formulates and supplies nutrient-rich fish feed tailored for different stages of fish farming.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From a single room to a pan&ndash;India presence, our journey reflects our commitment to quality, innovation, and the empowerment of fish farmers across the country. And we&apos;re just getting started.
