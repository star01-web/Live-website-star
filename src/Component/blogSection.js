  "title": "Why Cage Culture is the Future of Sustainable Aquaculture in India",
  "introduction": "Aquaculture in India is undergoing a silent revolution. With increasing demand for protein-rich food, shrinking land resources, and rising unemployment in rural areas, cage culture is emerging as a sustainable and profitable solution. By utilizing open water bodies like reservoirs, lakes, and rivers, cage culture allows fish farming with minimal environmental impact and maximum yield.",

    {
      "heading": "What is Cage Culture?",
      "content": "Cage culture involves rearing fish in floating enclosures (cages) made of mesh or netting material. These cages are anchored in large water bodies and allow free water exchange while protecting the fish from predators and theft.",
      "cageSizes": [
        "6×4×4 ft cages – suitable for small-scale farmers and pilot projects.",
        "20×20×5 ft cages – ideal for commercial production."
